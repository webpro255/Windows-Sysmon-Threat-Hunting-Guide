## Useful Queries and Filters

### Using Kibana as a Basic Search Tool
Kibana is not just a tool for complex queriesâ€”it's a powerful search engine that can be used for basic searches to find paths, processes, or other key information quickly. You can input raw strings, event IDs, or even partial command lines to narrow down your search and manually hunt for malicious activity.

#### **Manual Search Tips**:
1. **Avoid Wildcards** (`*`): Instead of relying on wildcards (which can be unreliable or slow), try searching for **specific terms** or **partial matches** directly by refining your query.
2. **Look for Exact Paths**: If youâ€™re hunting for suspicious file creation or execution, manually enter the **full or partial file path** (without wildcards) to locate exact matches.
3. **Command Line Searches**: When searching for specific command-line executions, focus on **exact keywords** (e.g., "powershell.exe", "mimikatz.exe") rather than using wildcards.
4. **Use Event IDs**: Event IDs are a straightforward and effective way to filter for specific system activities (e.g., logon events, process creation, network connections).

This repository is by no means an **exhaustive resource** for Windows and Sysmon Event Codes, queries, and threat hunting techniques. As I continue to explore new methods, tools, and strategies in the field of cybersecurity, I will be adding more **queries**, **filters**, and **techniques** to this repository.

The goal is to provide a **living resource** for anyone looking to improve their **threat hunting** and **incident response** skills. If you have suggestions, find useful queries, or think certain topics should be expanded, feel free to reach out or contribute. I encourage others in the cybersecurity community to share their knowledge as well.

Stay tuned for **future updates** as I keep learning and adapting to new threats and tools in the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity!
